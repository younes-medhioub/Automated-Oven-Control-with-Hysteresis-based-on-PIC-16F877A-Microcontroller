# Automated-Oven-Control-with-Hysteresis-based-on-PIC-16F877A-Microcontroller
In this project, we aim to develop an automated oven control system by leveraging the capabilities of the PIC 16F877A microcontroller.
Our focus will be on incorporating hysteresis into the control algorithm to enhance the system's performance. 
By utilizing hysteresis, we can achieve more accurate temperature regulation and improve the overall efficiency of the oven.

\\\\\****  WE USED DEVELOPED OUR FUCNTION , WE DIDINT USE PREDEFINED LIBRARIES  ****/////

requirements :
Softwar : 
  MPLABÂ® X IDE
  proteus professional 8 proteus professional 8 
Hardware : 
  PIC16F877A microcrontroller 
  LM032L LCD 16x2
  4x3 keypad
  LM35 sensor
  Buzzer
  Heater
  Fan

Notes : 
1/ we used EEPROM to store the entry temperature.
2/ the functions are well commented in the source code.
3/ the main function is simple.
4/ in order to run the code in the proteus you just add you HEX file to your microcontroller.
5/ we've used HYSTERESIS = 2 you can replace it with another value to suit your project.
